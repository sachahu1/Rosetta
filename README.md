Rosetta Quality Estimation

This project was developed by Ludo Mitchener (ludomitch), Alvaro Part (alvaroprat97), and Sacha Hu (me)

## Requirements

This project requires Python v3.6.x and pip3 to run.

## Setup

Requirements:
- Python 3
- pip3
- Java 6.0+

1. Install dependencies

Dependency management is done through pip.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Command line interface

```
Rosetta.

Usage:
  rosetta.py <mode> <save>

Options:
  -h --help     Show this screen.
```

## Available Scripts
From the root directory, you can run:

`python3 -m rosetta <mode> <save>` to run the rosetta training pipeline.
`<mode>` accepts the values 'no-extract' or 'extract' and decides respectively whether to load pre-generated features saved in the `/saved_features` directory or whether to extract the features from scratch.
`<save>` accepts 'T' of 'F'. T for if you want to save the model as model.pt and F if you do not want to save the model generated.

`python3 -m evolution` to run the evolutionary manager pipeline. No options are required as all config options are hard-coded into the python file.
